# Code snippets for Node.js examples

This is the repo of all the code samples we tried to learn required portion of Node.Js


## Usage

Each folder contains a set of files specific to a topic or example.
The description of each folder is given below.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/albysoltraining/nodejs-snippets.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    Need to install dependencies seperately for each folder where package.json exists.
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

# The Code Structure

This repository contains Node.js code organized into several folders, each serving a specific purpose.

## basic

The `basic` folder contains simple Node.js functions that demonstrate the usage of local and core modules. These functions cover basic concepts such as file system operations, HTTP server creation, and event handling.

## db

The `db` folder is dedicated to accessing a MySQL database from a Node.js application. It includes modules and scripts for establishing connections to a MySQL database, executing queries, and handling database operations seamlessly within Node.js environment.

## web

In the `web` folder, you will find examples of making simple Web API calls from HTML using Node.js. These examples illustrate how to create HTTP endpoints, handle incoming requests, and send responses back to the client using Node.js.

## web-form

The `web-form` folder contains code for a student registration form with login functionality. User data is stored in a JSON file for simplicity. This folder demonstrates how to handle form submissions, validate user input, and manage user authentication using Node.js and a JSON file as a storage mechanism.

## web-form-db

Finally, the `web-form-db` folder extends the functionality of the student registration form by integrating it with a MySQL database for storage. It allows users to register, login, and manage their accounts with data persistence in a MySQL database. This folder showcases the integration of Node.js with a relational database for robust and scalable web applications.

Each folder contains its own set of README.md files with detailed instructions on how to run and test the code within. Feel free to explore each folder to understand the concepts and implementations better.
